### Final Project
This website was created with a strong focus on usability, accessibility, and visual hierarchy to enhance user experience. It adapts seamlessly across multiple screen sizes (mobile, tablet, and desktop) and follows basic HCI principles to ensure intuitive navigation and readability.

### Key Features:
- Responsive Design: Layout adapts to `xs`, `sm`, `md`, and `lg` screen sizes using custom media queries.
- Accessible Typography: Clear font choices and contrast for readability across light/dark environments.
- Semantic HTML5: Proper use of `<section>`, `<nav>`, and `<article>` tags for improved structure and screen reader support.
- Modular CSS: CSS is broken down into base styles, layout rules, and responsive tweaks.

### Tools Used:
`HTML5`, `CSS`, `Bootstrap (icons only)`, `Media Queries`
