                <h3>South African Afro-House</h3>
                <p>The most globally recognized form of Afro-House originated in South Africa, characterized by soulful vocals, subtle percussion, and minimalist arrangements. Artists like Black Coffee, Culoe De Song, and Da Capo exemplify this style, which

                <h3>West African Afro-House</h3>
                <p>Incorporating elements from Ghana, Nigeria, and Ivory Coast, this sub-genre often features more prominent percussion, highlife guitar patterns, and call-and-response vocals. The energy level tends to be higher, with infectious rhythms
                    designed for continuous dancing.</p>
